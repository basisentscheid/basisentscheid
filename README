=== Installation ===

requirements:
- PHP >= 5.4 with modules: apache2 (or whatever webserver you use), cli, postgres, gettext, session, curl, ssl, unicode
- PostgreSQL

configuration:
$ cd inc/
$ cp config_example.php config.php
$ vi config.php

create database:
$ cd ../db/
$ ./recreate_schema.sh

The directory /var/ and all subdirectories need write access for the users as which PHP runs for web and cli:
$ find var/ -type d -exec chmod a+rwx {} \;

You can use the provided .htaccess files for configuration or copy their contents to the webserver config.
