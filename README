=== Installation ===

requirements:
- Some webserver, tested with apache and lighttpd
- PHP >= 5.4 with modules:
  - apache2, cgi or whatever you like to use to connect to the webserver
  - cli
  - postgres
  - gettext
  - session
  - unicode
  - gnupg PECL module http://pecl.php.net/package/gnupg (only if you want to sign/encrypt emails)
- PostgreSQL, works at least with 9.1 and 9.3
- GnuPG (only if you want to sign/encrypt emails)

generate PGP keys (only if you want to sign/encrypt emails):
$ gpg --homedir <base>/var/gnupg --gen-key
Leave the passphrase empty.
Send the public key to a key server:
$ gpg --homedir <base>/var/gnupg --no-permission-warning --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --send-keys <public-key-id>

The directory /var/ and all subdirectories need write access for the users as which PHP runs for web (usually
"apache", "www-data" or "httpd") and cli. You could use your login user for cli or a new dedicated user. In this
example we assume the user "cmr" for cli and "apache" for the webserver.
# groupadd basisentscheid
# usermod -G basisentscheid -a cmr
# usermod -G basisentscheid -a apache
# chgrp -R basisentscheid var/
# find var/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
# find var/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
To make the webserver use the new group, we have to restart it:
# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

For PHP configuration and for blocking access to some directories, use the provided .htaccess files or copy their
contents to the webserver config.

configuration:
$ cd inc/
$ cp config_example.php config.php
$ vi config.php

create database:
In Postgres create an empty database and make the role you're going to use owner of the schema "public" in that
database. Enter database name, role and password if needed to config.php. Then run:
$ db/recreate_schema.sh

create initial data:
$ cli/create_admin.php
$ cli/create_ngroups.php

run tests:
$ cli/test.php
$ cli/test_ballots.php
